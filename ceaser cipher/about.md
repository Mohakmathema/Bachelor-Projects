This was my first python project I created during the 1st semister of my bachelors degree.
This is a program that encrypts and decrypts text using the concept of ceaser cipher(sorry if I butchered the spelling).


<strong>Also, you'll need the message.txt file to encrypt or decrypt from a file using python. However for the 
results the program shall automatically create result.txt in the same directory.
</strong>

I also am open to changes and feedback. SO, if you have any changes and queries please feel free to do so.

Thankyou
