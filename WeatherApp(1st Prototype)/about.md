<b>This is the first prototype I created for my first assessment of university. </b>

This is a weather app I created uisng HTML, CSS and JS.
In this I used an external API source to fetch the weather data from the web and display it to the user.
However, this prototype does not include any sort of backend or local storage capabilities <b>(COMING SOON...)</b>
